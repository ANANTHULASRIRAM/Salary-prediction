# Salary-prediction

This project aims at building a supervised Machine Learning model to predict the salary class of a job applicant when his qualifications are provided.
Data Science is the "Hottest Job of 2019-20", many students and working professionals are making an industry shift into this field. There are a plethora of jobs with the title Data Scientist across different industries with various levels of expertise which makes the salary negotiation process difficult.
To establish fair transparency between the HR team and the job applicants, I have developed this model to give an expected salary range, analyzing the profiles of people working in the same field from different geographic locations.

Sequence of steps followed for the project are as below:

1. Import required libraries and create a dataframe of the CSV file
2. Identify feature and target variables, perform data cleaning by removing information that is not relavent to our study
3. Perform analysis on the cleaned data to identify the correlation, trends, statistical mean, diviations and so on
4. Perform feature selection using any tool like Lasso, random forest classifier and select important features
5. Further dimension reduction to by done by PCA and build a model with K fold cross validation
6. Once the model is done, we check for accuracy and perform parameter tuning to improve the accuray
7. Now that the improved accuracy is achieved, we proceed to apply model on unseen data and recheck the accuracy

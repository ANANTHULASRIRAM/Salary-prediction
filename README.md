# Salary-prediction

This project aims at building a supervised Machine Learning model to predict the salary class of a job applicant when his qualifications are provided.
Data Science is the "Hottest Job of 2019-20", many students and working professionals are making an industry shift into this field. There are a plethora of jobs with the title Data Scientist across different industries with various levels of expertise which makes the salary negotiation process difficult.
To establish fair transparency between the HR team and the job applicants, I have developed this model to give an expected salary range, analyzing the profiles of people working in the same field from different geographic locations.
